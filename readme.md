Have you ever wished for your own personal social calendar fairy?  Life takes over and prevents you from keeping all your plates spinning, and we can't have that- can we (especially with your mighty-fines)?!  RoRoster serves the role as this social calendar fairy.  This application will allow you to set reminders to contact your stud muffins via personalized countdowns.  Each timer is resetable to indicate that contact has been made.  Timers also indicate when contact is overdue.  On top of these features, there are mini profiles for each person the user plans to keep track of, making it easier for you to distinguish between boy/girlfriend #1 and boy/girlfriend #3.  

Features in summary:
Add/Edit/Delete mini-profiles boyfriend/girlfriends to track
Add/Delete a photo each of these boyfriend/girlfriends
Set a countdown for each boyfriend/girlfriend that will be resetable and indicate when time is up.

I have been attempting to RSpec this project from the beginning and am currently stuck due to a Turbolinks/Capybara Webkit shitty issues.  All my tests that are supposed to be passing fail, and ironically, my test that should be failing passes.  If this doesn't clear soon, I'm going to chuck RSpecing to the side because I need this to be done on Friday instead of Wednesday next week.
